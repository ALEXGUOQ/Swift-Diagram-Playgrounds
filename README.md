Enum-Oriented Programming
========

This is a an adaption of Apple’s sample code for the [Protocol-Oriented Programming in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=408) talk given during WWDC 2015.

Included is Apple’s original example playground file `Crustacean.playground` and an alternative version `CrustaceanEnumOriented.playground` that uses a recursive enum as the data structure.
